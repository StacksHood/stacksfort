# Project Issues & Tasks

This document outlines all the issues and tasks needed to complete the Stacks Multisig Vaults project. Contributors can pick up any of these issues to work on.


## Frontend Issues

### Workflow Overview

The multisig frontend follows this workflow:
1. **Transaction Submission**: Any signer submits a transaction on-chain (calls `submit-txn`)
2. **Off-chain Signing**: Signers sign the transaction hash off-chain using their wallet private keys
3. **Signature Storage**: Signatures are stored in a database/state until threshold is met
4. **Execution**: Once threshold signatures are collected, any signer can execute the transaction on-chain
